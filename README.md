# Harry-Potter-Website-Project
Here is the website I made as one project required for the Certificate of Proffesional Digital Competencies. I have received grade 10/10 on this project, along with other skills proven in the process of working towards this certificate. This was required to prove my HTML 5 skills, as well as my Javascript and CSS skills.
You can start this website by running the index.html file with any browser.
