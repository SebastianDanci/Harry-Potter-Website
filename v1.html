            <p class="description">Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is the first book in the Harry Potter series, written by J. K. Rowling.</p><br>

            <p class="description">Harry Potter is a boy who lives with his uncles and cousin. He was told that his parents died when he was only one year old in a car accident and his uncles have been taking care of him ever since. He is treated quite badly at home, sitting in a small room set up under the stairs. One day, Harry checks the mail and notices a letter addressed to him from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, but his uncle tears up the letter, preventing him from reading it. In the following days, a lot of owls bombard the mailbox with similar letters, which Uncle Vernon burns. In an effort to escape, the Dursley family moves from place to place, finally arriving on a deserted island.</p><br>

            <p class="description">That night when Harry was celebrating his birthday, Rubeus Hagrid, the keeper of the keys and keeper of the game at Hogwarts, knocked down the door to personally bring him a letter and a cake. He tells Harry that he is actually a wizard and if he wants to, he can go to Hogwarts to learn magic. Also his parents didn't die in a car accident, and his family had kept it from him in the vain hope that Harry wouldn't become a wizard. The next day he leaves with Hagrid to buy supplies. Entering the magical world of London, he discovers that he is famous for being Lord Voldemort's Boy Who Lived after he killed his parents, the only sign of the encounter being a scar in the shape of a lightning bolt.</p><br>

            <p class="description">Hagrid takes Harry to Gringotts, the wizarding bank, where they get, in addition to money, a mysterious package. After this, they go shopping, and Harry receives another gift: his very own messenger owl, Hedwig.</p><br>

            <p class="description">On the train that takes the students to Hogwarts, Harry makes two friends: Ron and Hermione. At school, students are divided into four houses: Hufflepuff, Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Ron, Hermione and Harry are sorted into Scouts, although the Sorting Wizard is having a hard time deciding between Viper and Scout when it's Harry's turn. In the following days, Harry gets to know the teachers, among whom he particularly dislikes Severus Snape (Snape), the Potions teacher. Harry takes his first broomstick lesson and does so well that he is selected for the Scout Quidditch team.</p><br>

            <p class="description">Draco Malfoy tricks Harry into a trap; Harry, Ron and Hermione run away from the meeting place, ending up in the third floor corridor, which is strictly off-limits to younger students. Randomly hiding in a room, they "meet" a giant three-headed dog guarding a hatch. Later, the three learn from Hagrid that this dog's name is Fluffy, and assume that it is guarding the mysterious package Hagrid took from Gringotts.</p><br>

            <p class="description">During Halloween dinner, Professor Quirell announces that an ogre (troll) has broken into the basement, and Dumbledore, the headmaster, sends everyone to their bedrooms. Harry and Ron separate from the group and go in search of the trap that Harry locks in the girls' bathroom. Realizing later that Hermione was in the bathroom with the troll, Harry and Ron barricade the door and after a short struggle manage to knock him unconscious, saving Hermione. For this, Hermione defends the two in front of Professor McGonagall. Harry notices that Professor Snape has a wound on his leg and assumes that he brought the ogre into Hogwarts castle as a diversion so he can get past Fluffy and take the guarded package. At Harry's first Hogwarts match, he can't control his broom , this being bewitched by a malevolent spectator. Hermione notices Snape muttering magical words, so sneaking under the stand, she stops him by setting his cloak on fire. As a result, the Scouts win thanks to Harry catching the Golden Snitch in his mouth, nearly choking on it.</p><br>

            <p class="description">Harry, Ron and Hermione interrogate Hagrid and learn that the package belongs to Nicholas Flamel. Consequently, the three begin looking all over the library for material on Nicholas Flamel, even trying the forbidden section.</p><br>

            <p class="description">For Christmas, Harry receives an invisibility cloak as a gift from a stranger, which the accompanying note said had belonged to Harry's father. Harry uses it to unobservedly search the forbidden section of the library for information on Nicholas Flamel, but the book he finds makes a terrible scream that gives him away. As he tried to make his way back to the Scout dormitories, Harry dodged Filch, the caretaker, (who had been alerted by the noises earlier) and Snape (whom Filch had informed). Hiding again in a nearby room, Harry stumbles upon the Mirror of Erised, in which he sees his parents. But when he tries to show it to Ron as well, the mirror shows Ron that he's Head of Series and that he won the House Cup and the Hogwarts Cup at Hogwarts.</p><br>

            <p class="description">After Harry stumbles across a mention of Nicholas Flamel, Hermione deduces that he is the creator of the Philosopher's Stone and the three conclude that the package Fluffy was guarding is the Philosopher's Stone, suspecting Snape of trying to steal it. Especially after, after a match of Hogwarts, Harry overhears Snape threatening Quirell in an empty classroom. Hagrid tells them, however, that Snape is guarding it, as are the other teachers, and under no circumstances wants to steal the Philosopher's Stone.</p><br>

            <p class="description">On the night Harry and Hermione help Hagrid get rid of an overgrown baby dragon, the two are discovered in the corridors (which is forbidden at night), being accosted by Draco, and Neville is also caught while he tries to find his two colleagues and warn them; for that all four (ie Draco too) are punished to help Hagrid. He takes them to the Forbidden Forest, where it has been discovered that someone is killing the unicorns to use the properties of their blood. Harry, Draco, and Fang just happen to catch this one, but they can't recognize him because he's hidden under a cloak. With no companions and about to be attacked, Harry is defended by the centaur Firenze. Based on what he had heard in the forest, Harry believes that Snape wants the Philosopher's Stone to bring Voldemort back to life.</p><br>

            <p class="description">The three learn that Hagrid told a stranger how you can annihilate Fluffy: by playing his music. Any music-like sound would have put the cerberus to sleep. The three decide to enter the room where they met Fluffy. They find that someone else has already entered before them, but they also have to deal with other security measures put in place by Dumbledore and the other teachers. Fluffy was only a warm-up for the tests that follow, after they manage to pass him, the first test follows which is represented by a plant called Latul Diavolului (Devil's Snare) that coils itself on the victim until it strangles it. Using a spell, Hermione burns the plant which immediately frees them. The second test is to find the key that will allow them to go further, through an old wooden door with a silver handle. With the help of his friends, Harry manages to get the right Key and quickly sticking it in the lock the door opens, they pass on. The third obstacle is a man-sized chess set. Ron manages to win, but only by sacrificing himself. Moving on, Harry and Hermione discover the obstacle posed by Professor Snape, an ingenious riddle based on potions. The riddle is quickly solved by Hermione, whom Harry sends back to Ron to help him and to send an owl to Dumbledore informing him of what has happened. Hermione stays to notify the teachers and Harry continues. In the last room, where the last test should have been waiting for him, Harry finds a dead troll, probably killed by the one who entered there before him. Harry reaches the last room, but he doesn't find Professor Snape inside, but Professor Quirell, in front of the Mirror of Erised, not knowing what to do. It has Voldemort attached to the back of his head, who is trying to use Harry to get his hands on the Philosopher's Stone. But the plan fails, and the Stone stays with Harry. Quirell tries to take the Stone by force, but burns himself when it touches Harry. Harry wakes up some time later in the infirmary, having gifts from admirers. Dumbledore tells him that Ron and Hermione are fine and that the Philosopher's Stone has been destroyed, meaning that Nicholas Flamel will die not long after. During the end-of-year feast, Dumbledore gives some last minute points to the Scouts and they win the House Cup.</p><br>
