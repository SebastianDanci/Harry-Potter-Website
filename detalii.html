          <h3>Details</h3>

          <p>The Harry Potter volumes form a very popular series around the world; they belong to the fantasy genre and were written by the British author J. K. Rowling. The books deal with a wizarding world, with the protagonist being a young wizard named Harry Potter, along with his friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. The story mostly takes place at Hogwarts, School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, a school for young wizards and magicians. The central point of the story is the conflict between Harry and the dark wizard Voldemort, who killed Harry's parents in his mission to conquer the wizarding world.</p>

                Players use flying brooms to move through the air. The aim of the game is to catch the Golden Snitch, a small and fast ball, as quickly as possible. In addition to this "thief" there are also two cannonballs, which aim to unbalance the opponents from the brooms and last but not least the game ball (balloon) which must be thrown by the attackers of a team through one of the three rings of opposing portions. There are four teams at Hogwarts, each belonging to a representative house.

                It has the role of sorting students from Hogwarts into the four houses: Slytherin, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw and Gryffindor. It has been used since the creation of the school, the only ones who were not sorted being the founders. The Magic Joben has the duty to sort the students but also to warn the students about the dangers that threaten the school or the wizarding society. When a student gets his job, he looks for the four qualities (courage, cunning, intelligence and fear) among the students' qualities and sends them to a house.

                Considered the greatest Dark Wizard of all time, Voldemort is so powerful that most witches and wizards are afraid to even pronounce his name, using euphemisms such as He-Whose-Name-Must-Not-Speak or You-Know-Who / We-Know-Who. He is also known to be a Reptomite (meaning he speaks the language of snakes) and is an expert in Legilimancy (reading thoughts) and Occlumancy (hiding thoughts).

        <p> <p>Since the release of the first volume, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, in 1997, the books have gained immense popularity and commercial success around the world. All seven volumes have sold more than 450 million copies and have been translated into more than 63 languages. The seventh and final book in the Harry Potter series, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, was released on July 21, 2007. The publishers announced a record 12 million copies sold in the United States for the first edition.</p>

          <p>The success of her novels made Rowling the richest writer in history. English versions of the books were published by Bloomsbury in the United Kingdom, Scholastic Press in the United States, Allen & Unwin in Australia, and Raincoast Books in Canada. All seven volumes of the series were screened by Warner Bros.</p></p>

          <p>The world of magic that Harry lives in is completely separate, but also very close to our world. While the fantasy universe of Narnia is an alternative universe to our own, and the universe of The Lord of the Rings represents a mythical past, the magical world of Harry Potter exists at the same time as our own, with magical elements analogous to our own. Many institutes and localities are located in real-world towns and villages, for example the Ministry of Magic which is located in London. This universe consists of a fragmented collection of secret streets, ancient paths, lonely manors and castles that remain invisible to the eyes of non-magical people (known as "Locked Up"/ "Muggles", ex: the Dursleys).</p>

          <p>The ability to produce magic is acquired through family rather than learning it, however those who have this ability must attend a school, like Hogwarts, to learn to use and master magic. However, there are also wizard parents whose children do not have the ability to produce magic, they are called "nonis" (eg: Mrs. Figg, Argus Filch). There are also wizards whose parents do not have magical abilities, who are said to have "mudblood" (eg: Hermione Granger).</p>

          <p>Wizards whose parents have magical abilities and both of their parents come from parents with magical abilities are "purebloods" (eg: Ronald Weasley), and those who have only one parent with magical abilities or have only one parent with "blood- pure", and the other has "mud-blood" they have "semi-pure blood" (ex: Harry Potter). The magical world and its many fantastical elements are depicted in a surprising and magnificent way. The merging of the magical with the normal is one of the main motifs in the novel; the characters in the story live an ordinary life with its ordinary problems, in an entirely magical world. On June 18, 2010, the Harry Potter theme park opened in Orlando, Florida.</p>
