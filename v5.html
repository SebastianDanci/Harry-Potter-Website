            <p class="description">Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is ​​the fifth volume in the Harry Potter series, belonging to the writer J. K. Rowling. It is the longest book in the entire series, and was released on June 21, 2003. The novel follows Harry's endeavors in his fifth year at Hogwarts, including a confrontation with the Deathly Hallows, the N.O.V. exams, teenage love, and a Ministry of Magic that block development. The movie came out in 2007.</p><br>

            <p class="description">Harry Potter creates a Patronus spell when he and his cousin Dudley Dursley are attacked by dementors, which can get him expelled. Members of the Order of the Phoenix arrive shortly afterwards to take Harry to their headquarters, where he joins the Weasleys, Hermione Granger, and his godfather, Sirius Black. He learns that Lord Deathhead is gathering an army to recover a "weapon". Meanwhile, thanks to the testimony of Albus Dumbledore and his neighbor Arabella Figg, he is acquitted of all charges of unauthorized use of magic.</p><br>

            <p class="description">At Hogwarts, a new teacher has been appointed in the person of Dolores Umbridge, appointed by the Ministry to keep the school under control. The subject matter is changed, being taught only the theory imposed by the ministry, and not the practical things that the students would need. She is later appointed inquisitor, imposing strict rules and harsh punishments. Her authority also extends to the teachers, with her firing Trelawney and threatening Hagrid with the same.</p><br>

            <p class="description">Harry has nightmares, in which he dreams of a snake attacking Ron's father. To protect him, Dumbledore has Severus Snape teach Harry Occlumency, which will protect him, but the animosity between the two prevents them from completing their lessons.</p><br>

            <p class="description">Because the lessons taught at school are useless to them, Harry, on Hermione's advice, teaches the Scouts, Astropuffs, and Hawkeyes defense tactics against dark magic. Their clandestine group is called Dumbledore's Army. They are eventually discovered, but Dumbledore takes responsibility, and then runs away to avoid arrest.</p><br>

            <p class="description">Umbridge becomes the new Headmistress of Hogwarts, and fires Hagrid. Her lack of popularity causes Fred and George to riot and creates chaos in the school.</p><br>

            <p class="description">Harry has a vision of Sirius being tortured at the Ministry of Magic, and tries to contact Sirius, but is caught. Umbridge then reveals that she is the one who sent the Dementors to attack Harry, and prepares to use the Cruciatus Curse against him. Hermione, however, declares herself ready to show him where Dumbledore's alleged weapon is hidden in the Forbidden Forest. She, Harry, and Umbridge go into the forest, where they encounter centaurs. Umbridge insults them, and is kidnapped by them, and Hermione and Harry escape, and along with Dumbledore's Army companions Ginny, Neville and Luna, fly to the Ministry of Magic on the school's thestrals.</p><br>

            <p class="description">At the Ministry, they are attacked by Death Eaters. When they are almost defeated, members of the Order of the Phoenix arrive. In the ensuing battle, the prophecy Cap-de-Mort was looking for is destroyed. Sirius is killed by his cousin, Bellatrix Lestrange.</p><br>

            <p class="description">The Death Eaters are all captured except for Bellatrix Lestrange who escapes through a chimney during the fight between Death's Head and Albus Dumbledore during which Death's Head enters Harry trying to possess him, but Ministry men appear who they make him leave leaving Harry.</p><br>

            <p class="description">Dumbledore reveals to Harry the contents of the lost prophecy, which was made to him by Sybill Trelawney. Apparently, either Harry or Death's Head must die, for neither can live while the other survives.</p><br>
