            <p class="description">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows topped the bestseller lists just hours after the book's release date was announced on February 1, 2007</p><br>

            <p class="description">After Dumbledore's death, Voldemort continues to gain support. When Harry turns seventeen, the protection provided by his mother and his aunt and uncle's house is broken, and he flees to the Burrow with his friends (many of whom use Polyjuice Potion to impersonate Harry so as to mislead any Death Eater, who follow them). </p><br>

            <p class="description">They are attacked, but the Burrow is reached safely. Harry, Ron and Hermione know they cannot return to Hogwarts School for their seventh year, instead they complete Dumbledore's mission: to hunt down and destroy Voldemort's remaining Horcruxes, objects in which he has hidden parts of his soul, in order to be immortal. They have isolated themselves to ensure the protection of their friends and their families." They have little knowledge of the remaining horcruxes, except for the possibility that two are objects belonging to the founders of Hogwarts Rowena Ravenclaw, Helga Hufflepuff, and a third may be Nagini, the snake of Voldemort. </p><br>

            <p class="description">Locating the objects of the two founders is difficult, and Nagini is supposed to be with Voldemort. As they search for the Horcruxes, the trio learn more about Dumbledore's past. Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour are married, but the wedding is interrupted by the news that Voldemort has taken over the Ministry of Magic. Harry, Ron and Hermione flee to London and arrive at Complete House No. 12, where they find out with the help of Kreacher where Salazar Viper's locket is. They successfully retrieve this Horcrux by infiltrating the Ministry of Magic and stealing it from Dolores Umbridge. Under the influence of the evil object and the stress of being on the run, Ron leaves Harry and Hermione.</p><br>

            <p class="description">They, after a long time spent hiding in the country, decide to travel to Godric's Hollow, Harry's birthplace and the place where his parents died, in Godric's Hollow they meet the magical historian Bathilda Bagshot, who turns out to be Nagini in disguise and attack them. They escape into the Forest of Dean, the mysterious part begins when a silver deer (a patronus) leads Harry to the Godric Gryffindor Sword at the bottom of a frozen lake, one of the few objects capable of destroying a Horcrux. When Harry tries to retrieve the sword from the lake, the horcrux tries to kill him. Ron reappears, fixed on the tank for Harry saving him, later using his sword to destroy the locket. Ron was not received by Hermione as warmly as Harry, she started yelling at him. After resuming their search, the trio encounters in several cases a strange symbol that was also seen around the neck of an eccentric wizard named Xenophilius Lovegood. In the end, they decide to pay Xenophilius Lovegood a visit, he tells them that he represents the 3 mythical Talismans of Death.</p><br>

            <p class="description">The talismans are three sacred objects: the Resurrection Stone, with the power to summon the dead to the world of the living; The Elder Wand, an unparalleled wand, as well as the supreme Invisibility Cloak. Harry learns that Voldemort is looking for the Elder Wand, but is unaware of the talismans and their meaning. The trio are captured and taken to Reassurance Manor, where Bellatrix Lestrange tortures Hermione. Harry and Ron encounter Luna Lovegood, Ollivander, Dean Thomas, and also Griphook held in the cellar. They all manage to escape and flee to Shell Cottage (Bill and Fleur's home), with Dobby's help, but at the cost of the house elf's life. Harry learns that Voldemort has robbed Dumbledore's tomb and taken the Shock Wand, but he decides to focus on Horcruxes instead of Hallows. With Griphook's help, they manage to break into Bellatrix's vault at Gringotts Wizarding Bank, which they believe contains another Horcrux. Their guess is correct and they manage to get hold of Helga Hufflepuff's cup and escape using a dragon. Harry learns that another Horcrux is hidden in Hogwarts, which is under the control of Severus Snape. Harry, Ron, Hermione enter the school through Hogsmeade (being saved by Aberforth Dumbledore, who explains more about Albus' story), with the help of the teachers Snape is expelled from the school. The Death Eaters and Voldemort storm the school, while Harry, Ron, Hermione search for the Horcrux related to Ravenclaw. At the same time, Ron and Hermione go to the Chamber of Secrets and destroy the cup.</p><br>

            <p class="description">The trio find Rowena Ravenclaw's tiara (the last Horcrux made from school founders' items) in the Chamber of Requirement. The Diadem is destroyed by the Cursed Fire summoned by Vincent Crabbe in a desperate attempt to kill Harry, Ron, Hermione and sadly ends with his own death. Voldemort and his followers lay siege to Hogwarts. Harry, Ron, Hermione, their allies and various magical creatures fight to defend Hogwarts. Several of the school's protectors are killed in the first wave of battle, including Remus Lupin, Nymphadora Tonks, and Fred Weasley. Voldemort kills Severus Snape because he believes that this will make him the true master of the Elder Wand. Harry discovers while watching the memories that Snape gives him on his deathbed that he sees that Voldemort unknowingly made Harry into a Horcrux when he attacked him as a child, and Harry must die for Voldemort to be able to be killed. These memoirs also confirm Snape's unwavering loyalty to Dumbledore and that his role as a double agent against Voldemort was decided when Voldemort killed Lily Evans who was Harry's mother and great love Snape's.</p><br>

            <p class="description">After learning these things that he was raised and kept safe until the moment he is ready to die (Harry must die at Voldermort's hand). Harry decides to surrender to Voldemort, uses the Resurrection Stone to bring his parents, nose and friends who died in that battle to his side as he goes quietly to his death. Once in the Forbidden Forest, he finds Voldemort surrounded by Death Eaters. Harry embraces death peacefully for he sacrifices himself for those he loves (love being a type of magic that Voldermort knows about but does not really believe seeing only the effects of this very old and very powerful magic). Harry is hit by the fatal curse known in the wizarding world as the Unforgivable Curse of Abracadabra, he dies on the spot. He wakes up in a place that he associates with King's Cross station. There he meets with Dumbledore who explains that when Voldemort used Harry's blood to regain his full power, he took over the protection provided by Harry's mother.</p><br>

            <p class="description">Voldemort killed with his own hand the part of his soul that was inside Harry was destroyed and he can return to his body despite being hit by Abracadabra. Dumbledore also explains that Harry became a true master of the Deathly Hallows, not by trying to avoid or conquer it, but by accepting it. Harry returns to his body, feigning death, and Voldemort triumphantly marches into the castle with his body. However, he reveals that he is still alive as Neville Longbottom emerges from the crowd and opposes him, mustering enough courage when Harry is seen alive to slay Nagini, the last horcrux, with the sword of Gryffindor drawn from the Magic Job. . The battle has begun again, and Bellatrix Lestrange is killed by Molly Weasley. Harry duels with Voldemort one last time, Voldemort is finally defeated because Harry is the true master of the Shock Wand (Draco becomes its master when he disarms Dumbledore in the Astronomy tower, and Harry becomes its master when disarms Draco in Reacredinta manor) the wand refused to kill its rightful master. Instead, Voldemort's unforgivable curse turns against him. Death's Head and the Death Eaters were defeated. The magical world has been saved and peace can be restored again.</p><br>

            <p class="description">We remember the price that was paid for this peace. The lives of great wizards: Remus Lupin, Nymphadora Tonks, Fred Weasley, Sirius Black, Albus Dumbledore, Severus Snape, Mad-Eyes Moody and last but not least, even if he was not a wizard, he fought side by side with them helping our heroes throughout this journey: Dobby the Free Goblin</p><br>

            <p class="description">The novel, the last in the series, closes with a short epilogue set 19 years later, in which Harry and Ginny Weasley are a married couple with three children: James Sirius, Albus Severus and Lily Luna. Ron and Hermione are married and have two children, Rose and Hugo. The families meet at Kings Cross station, where Albus Severus is nervous about leaving for Hogwarts. Harry's son Teddy Lupin is found kissing Bill and Fleur's daughter Victoire Weasley in a train carriage. Harry sees Draco Reassurance and his wife with their son, Scorpio. Neville Poponeata is now a professor at Hogwarts. He teaches Herbology and remains friends with the two families. Harry comforts Albus, who is worried about being sent to the Vipers. Harry tells him that his middle name Severus was that of a great headmaster at Hogwarts who was a Viper and also the bravest man he had ever met. He adds that the hat also takes into account the wishes of the students, just as it took into account his own wishes as a child. The book ends with these final words: "The scar hadn't hurt Harry for 19 years. Everything was fine."</p><br>
