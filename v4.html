            <p class="description">Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is the fourth volume in the Harry Potter series.</p><br>

            <p class="description">In his fourth year at Hogwarts, Harry is once again in trouble. The first sign of them appears before the start of the Hogwarts World Cup when he has a dream with Death's Head and Peter Pettigrew talking about killing Harry. Another one is before classes, right after the finals of the World Cup of Hogwarts, when a group of Death Eaters create chaos in the campsite where the spectators of the finals had stayed, and the Mark of Lord Voldemort appears in the sky - created precisely with Harry's wand!</p><br>

            <p class="description">At the School, the suspension of the Hogwarts Quidditch Cup is announced, due to the resumption of the tradition of the Tri-Wizard Tournament. This is a competition for students at various Magic Schools around the world, where participants must pass three very difficult tests to bring the trophy into their school's possession. To enter the contest, a student must first register by entering a ticket with their name in the Goblet of Fire; and this year's conditions require the participants to be from their last year of studies. The conditions being imposed by magical restrictions, Harry doesn't get into trouble, but unexpectedly, it turns out that Harry's name was still put inside; and not by a friend, as Sirius Black would point out. When the Goblet selects a fourth participant, everyone is outraged, but nothing can be changed: the Goblet has made its decision, and Harry will have to participate in the tournament.</p><br>

            <p class="description">The first test takes place shortly after the start of the Tournament. No one is supposed to know what the task is in the first trial, but Hagrid reveals it to Harry: four great, huge dragons are to fight the Tournament champions. Harry is unhappy that the audience might think he is cheating, but when he learns that the two overseas champions, Fleur Delacour and Viktor Krum, also know as much, he decides to also tell Cedric Diggory, the champion representing Hogwarts. Of the dragons, the most evil and fierce was considered the Hungarian Target, and it was this that fell to Harry by drawing lots. Although Harry doesn't really know how to deal with the dragon, but with the help of Professor Moody and Hermione he practices and perfects his summoning spell, Accio. When it's his turn to fight the dragon, Harry manages to summon his broom, a Firebolt given to him as a gift by his godfather, thus managing to escape from the dragon's fiery trap. After a while proving that he is indeed very good at flying, Harry passes the first test and learns that the golden egg he picked up is a clue to the next one.</p><br>

            <p class="description">The second test turns out to be more difficult to discover, prepare and face.</p><br>

            <p class="description">In the third trial, the champions have to find their way through a magical maze where the Tournament Cup is located. Whoever takes the cup first wins the contest and the prize of 1000 galleons. After some misadventures in the maze, Harry and Cedric find the cup at the same time. They jostle each other, not knowing who should take the cup, but then they decide to both take it at the same time. As soon as they touch it, they find themselves in a graveyard; suddenly Sobo appears, who unexpectedly kills Cedric. Harry is immobilized and tied to a tombstone that reads "Tomas Dorlent Cruplud" (Tom Marvolo Riddle). Sobo prepares a magical ritual, for an ugly, disgusting and almost helpless creature, which he puts in a cauldron; then uses a "father's bone, given without his knowledge" (a bone from the grave at Harry's feet is used), "fiber... of the servant... given of... willingly" (Shobo cuts his hand right!) and "the blood of the enemy.. taken by force" (Shobo stabs Harry in the arm).</p><br>

            <p class="description">After the completion of the ritual, Cap-de-Mort revives and calls his servants - the Death Eaters. In front of them he wants to show them that he is as strong as before: he duels Harry. But when Harry's disarming spell collides with the fatal curse (Abracadabra / Avada Kedavra) sent by Death's Cap, the two wands are surprisingly joined by a golden ray, which unravels and turns into a web shaped like a dome that separates them from the Death Eaters. After intense concentration, Harry manages to repel a strange and unknown phenomenon occurring along the golden thread, and on a hunch pushes it towards Voldemort's wand. Under the dome, the ghosts of the wand's spells begin to appear: the silver hand he created earlier for Bobo, then Cedric, Bertha Jorkins, and finally Lily and James Potter, Harry's parents!</p><br>

            <p class="description">These ghosts create a diversion that gives Harry time to reach the portkey to be instantly transported back to Hogwarts. Harry complies with Cedric's request to take his lifeless body back to Hogwarts, back to his father, but when he gets to him he can't drag Cedric's heavy body to the goblet, so he uses a call, by which he brings the cup to him and escapes the graveyard.</p><br>

            <p class="description">Even back at Hogwarts, the danger has not stopped, as Professor Moody turns out to be an impostor, none other than Barty Crouch Jr., who has been using polyjuice potion to assume the appearance of veteran Alastor "Mad-Eye" Moody. After his capture, preparations follow for a new confrontation with Death's Head, much more dangerous now than in previous years. Harry, however, must return during the holiday to his only blood relatives, the Dursleys.</p><br>
